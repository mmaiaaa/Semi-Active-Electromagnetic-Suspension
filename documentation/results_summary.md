## Results Summary

The simulated suspension system demonstrated clear performance improvements over the passive suspension system.

### Ride Comfort
- PD controller achieved the highest RMS acceleration reduction (20%)
- PID reduced RMS acceleration by 17.9%
- LQR achieved a 10.5% reduction

### Displacement Control
- LQR achieved the smallest peak body displacement (≈ 0.0635 m)
- Faster oscillation decay compared to PD and PID

### Actuator Effort
- PD and PID required actuator forces up to ±1500 N
- LQR operated within a lower force range (±800 N)
- LQR demonstrated more consistent and energy-efficient power usage

### Overall Performance
- PD: Best ride comfort and vibration attenuation
- PID: Improved steady-state behavior with minor overshoot
- LQR: Best displacement regulation and energy efficiency

The results highlight a trade-off between comfort-focused control and energy-efficient regulation.
