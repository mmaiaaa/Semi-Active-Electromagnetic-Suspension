## Limitations and Assumptions

The following limitations apply to this study:

- Linearized suspension dynamics
- No actuator saturation or thermal modeling
- No sensor noise or time-delay effects
- Quarter-car model only (no roll or pitch dynamics)
- Manual controller tuning without optimization algorithms

Future work may include nonlinear modeling, auto-tuning of controllers, and hardware testing for actuator validation.
